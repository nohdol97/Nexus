# GitOps Commit Example

This is a minimal example to turn a pipeline output into a Git commit.

## Assumptions

- `kserve_manifest.yaml` is generated by the pipeline.
- You have a Git repo path where Argo CD watches manifests.

## Example commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nexus-deployments.git
cd nexus-deployments
mkdir -p deployments/kserve
cp /workspace/kserve_manifest.yaml deployments/kserve/llm-vllm.yaml
git add deployments/kserve/llm-vllm.yaml
git commit -m "Deploy llm-vllm"
git push
```
